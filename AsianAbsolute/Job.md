## Job Description

You’ll be working on SmartBase, our core platform which is used by Client, Vendors, Project Managers, Sales, Marketing, Vendor Management and Finance. SmartBase drives productivity, accuracy and reliability through cloud solutions, on Azure and Amazon S3. 

We started development of SmartBase in 2007 on Visual Basic. In 2014 we started migration from Visual Basic to C# through Asp.Net MVC. 

Working on SmartBase your main responsibility will be backend, but you should be able to adapt the frontend just as easily to connect to your new features. We don't have the luxury of a big front- and backend team, yet ;-)

SmartBase grows every year and we need a developer to help with this.

## SmartBase Overview

Existing modules include:

  - Client database and CRM functionality
  - Supplier database
  - Project management system, including client and supplier details, deadlines, details of services and tasks
  - Quote and Purchase Order generation
  - Generation of sales invoices
  - Vendor Portal, allowing suppliers to log in and submit invoices against Purchase Orders
  - Client Portal, allowing clients to create new projects and upload files
  - Analysis functions

## We expect `from you`

Web development is your favourite activity anyway? Are your interested in .Net, Cloud and Azure solutions? Are you a keen learner? Do you like tinkering with the latest web technology? Then you will definitely have an interesting time with SmartBase. You know your way around in software development. You're handling both backend and frontend development with ease. You know the definition of "done" is not: "it works for me"?! So you don't hesitate to actually test your software on Azure? You can give and receive code-reviews as a professional who wants to improve him/herself and life for colleagues? You know what version control is and why you should be using it.

You're ready to expand your horizons? Then you will definitely enjoy working with us!

You'll be joining a friendly environment in which you don't have to be afraid to speak your mind or ask permission to show how you think you should get something done. As long as your goal aligns with that of the team: get things done!

## Your skills

  - You're experienced in Asp.Net MVC
  - You're experienced in Azure
  - You like working with people from other planets like Project Managers
  - You're not someone who waits until told what to do but contributes and takes initiative
  - Previous experience in cloud deployments, devops is a plus
  - Fluent in English speaking/writing.
