Talk is cheap. Show me the code / examples is a famous quote by Linus Torvalds. My goal is to give you an introduction why my Nextjs, React and UI and UX skills are important for your business and of course I want to impress you!

#1 The first example is the latest project in my portfolio: https://getcraft.com (Please visit the website)

My collaboration with Fanny Yap (Front - End Consultant.png) won in the last three months:

- VC funding. GetCraft receives a funding investment a month ago. The new homepage was one of the key players the deal to be completed.
- One of the biggest problems for my client was branding and identity. With the latest version for the end user is more easier to find or contact creative people in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Singapore.

#2 https://ddanailov.dev/ (Please visit the website). Note: My website has an offline version.
The main technology stack behind my website is NextJs. I'm using my website as a playground. A significant amount of components are production ready can be used from your website.

I can assure you:
