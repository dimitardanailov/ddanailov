#4 Asian Absolute (Software Architect - Azure.png)

"For 7 years Dimitar masterminded the development of the web app which I used to run most aspects of my language services business. We were not an easy client but he found an elegant solution for each one of the challenges which our business threw at him. He imposed structure and efficiency on our in-house, agency and freelance dev teams and introduced a series of new tools and technologies to make the app more resilient and effective. He's an accomplished software architect but he doesn't hesitate to roll his sleeves up and debug code in the middle of the night when that's what's needed. Dimitar is a highly intelligent and knowledgeable professional with an exemplary work ethic."
