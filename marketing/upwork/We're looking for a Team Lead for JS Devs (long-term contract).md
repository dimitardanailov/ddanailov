Your job post grabbed my attention instantly!

I've been working as a Consultant, Solution Architect or Software Engineering Manager in the past ten years.

My winner mentality gave me an opportunity to work with remote teams in Israel, Indonesia, Singapore, US, Australia, UK, Bulgaria. I received several five stars reviews from stakeholders, product managers and devmates -> https://ddanailov.dev/about#about-testimonials-recommendations.

My StackOverflow and Medium profiles can be used as a representation for my core skills: I love to teach other developers.

My last three jobs were remote long term contracts. The teams were multinational.
