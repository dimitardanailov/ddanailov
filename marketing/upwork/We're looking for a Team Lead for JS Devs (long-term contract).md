Greetings,

Your job post grabbed my attention instantly!

I've been working as a Consultant, Solution Architect or Software Engineering Manager in the past ten years.

I'd like to emphasize the image with the name: Mentorship.png. The image can give you five stars reviews why I'm an outstanding mentor and team lead. My winner mentality gave me an opportunity to work with remote teams in Israel, Indonesia, Singapore, US, Australia, UK, Bulgaria. I received several five stars reviews from stakeholders, product managers and devmates -> https://ddanailov.dev/about#about-testimonials-recommendations.

My Stackoverflow profile has 9000+ points. My expertise is a valuable knowledge portal for more than five millions people. My articles are a useful source for 300 - 400 people each week!

My StackOverflow and Medium profiles can be used as a representation for my core skills: I love to teach other developers.

If you choose me, you are assured that you're getting a high level performer. My expertise is mix between:

- Cloud Development and DevOps;
- last but not least: Managing remote teams;

My last three jobs were remote long term contracts. The teams were multinational.

My main responsibility was: Team management and leadership. My passion and my proposals won important clients, contracts, partnerships, VC and angel investment and new team members.

I can assure you that if you work with me once, you will always work with me for these kinds of projects; I will do whatever it takes to completely 100% deliver on this project and earn a 5 star rating from you as well.
