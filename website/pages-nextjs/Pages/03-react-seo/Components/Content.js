        <h4>Google bot: Overview and architecture</h4>
        <p>The architecture behind Google crawler is: Architecture</p>
        <SourceBlockQuote
          title="The new evergreen Googlebot"
          href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2019/05/the-new-evergreen-googlebot.html"
        >
          Googlebot is the crawler that visits web pages to include them within
          Google Search index. The number one question we got from the community
          at events and social media was if we could make Googlebot evergreen
          with the latest Chromium. Today, we are happy to announce that
          Googlebot now runs the latest Chromium rendering engine (74 at the
          time of this post) when rendering pages for Search. Moving forward,
          Googlebot will regularly update its rendering engine to ensure support
          for latest web platform features.
        </SourceBlockQuote>
        <p>
          The announcement added more than 1000+ features. The top three
          announcements are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>EcmaScript 6 support</li>
          <li>
            <TargetBlank

            </TargetBlank>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Why the announcement is important for the React community: Step by
          step the large enterprise applications are migrated from old Monolith
          application to Single Page Application. My expectations are in the
          next a few years more jQuery applications to be migrated to React.

        <p>The next chapter is common mistakes</p>
        <h4>The common mistakes?</h4>
        Google is one of the leading tech companies in our planet and in page
        SEO optimization can be a tough job! If you want Google to increase SEO
        index vs SEO penalties please add in your radar
        <ul>
          <li>DRY pattern</li>
          <li>Good naming conventions</li>
          <li>Lazy loading</li>
          <li>Caching</li>
          <li>Compression</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The chapter will start with Basic / common mistakes. The final part
          will be advance subjects as Compression, Caching and Google AppLight
          House.
        </p>
        <h5>GoogleBot is more important vs the end user</h5>
        <p>
          The main traffic in your website will be Google Searches. The next
          three sources are: Social Links, Direct Traffic, Link Building. SEO
          optimization is important and critical for each website. My advice is
          focus on customers / the end - user. Please be careful with bounce
          rate and SEO penalty.
        </p>
        <h6>What's bounce rate ?</h6>
        <p>
          Bounce rate are not valuable users for your website. The typical
          bounce rate session is between 1 second and 45 seconds. If the end
          user is not happy from the page content he or she will close the page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bounce rate are not valuable users for your website. The typical
          bounce rate session is between 1 second and 45 seconds. If the end
          user is not happy from the page content he or she will close the page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tip: Google soon or later will add SEO penalties for the cheaters. The
          strong organic traffict must be your long term goal.
        </p>
        <h5>Hyperlinks</h5>
        <p>
          Each website has at least one HyperLink. Unfortunately if your team
          doesn’t have experience with SEO the common mistakes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Title attribute is missing</li>
          <li>JavaScript onClickEvents</li>
          <li>Target blank is missing or doesn’t have rel="noopener"</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Title attribute is missing</h6>
        <p>
          Google loves hyperlinks. The common mistake is the title attribute is
          missing or title attribute is not relevant with the page content.
        </p>
        <h6>onClick listener</h6>
        <p>
          The second mistake: the engineers love onClick events. If you want
          good SEO results please avoid onClick listeners if the element is a
          navigation element.
        </p>
        <h6>target="_blank"</h6>
        <p>
          The attribute opens the desired link in the new tab. The main issues
          in our days with target="_blank" are security or performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want google to skip penalties the magic attributes is:
          rel="noopener" or rel="noreferrer"
        </p>
        <TargetBlankExample />
        <h5>Images</h5>
        <p>Image optimization is a tricky subject. The common mistakes:</p>
        <h6>Random / stupid names</h6>
        <p>
          If you want image optimization please be careful with image
          conventation. My advice is: the images must be meaningful.
        </p>
        <ImageInvalidName />
        <h6>Image dimensions</h6>
        <p>
          If the page requires image with size 180x150 you must provide image
          with these dimensions. One of the common mistake is the server
          response returns image with size 2000x2000. Google ads seo penalties:
          Your page is not mobile friendly, the internet traffic in our days is
          a hot subject, the browser must resize image. Each resize requires CPU
          and memory. Google doesn’t like expansive website for the end user.
        </p>
        <h5>Compression</h5>
        <h6>Webp and Webm</h6>
        <p>
          Webp and Webm are a new standard in the web development. The numbers
          behind Webp are:
        </p>
        <SourceBlockQuote
          title="A new image format for the Web"
          href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp"
        >
          WebP lossless images are 26% smaller in size compared to PNGs. WebP
          lossy images are 25-34% smaller than comparable JPEG images at
          equivalent SSIM quality index.
        </SourceBlockQuote>
        <p>
          Webp is not supported by Safari, iOS Safari and IE. The main reason
          Apple to be not interested by Webp is the browser war with Google.
        </p>
        <p>I'd like to share how we can create a reusable web component</p>
        <ImageReusable />
        <h6>Video compression</h6>
        <p>
          Webm is the video equivalent. Webm has better browser support if you
          compare with webp. The format is supported by the latest Safari, iOS
          Safari. The important note is: The support is partial
        </p>
        <BlockQuote>Only supports VP8 used in WebRTC.</BlockQuote>
        <p>
          Unfortunately my experience in this area is not so big. I can't
          advantages and disadvantages between VP8 and VP9. I can give you my
          personal opinion: Our generation is living in the industrial age and
          we're busy. The video usage is increase each year. If you want
          competitor advantage: video is one of the hot areas.
