        Being a non-technical lead PM, there are a number of instances where I
        absolutely commend Dimitar taking the time in preparations visually and
        verbally to share his perspectives, recommendations and solutions,
        facilitating to helping me personally understand and navigate (tech)
        better, with a goal of improving the process between design and
        development. His positive agenda is to always continue to improve the
        performance and usability of our platform, with our users experience in
        mind.

        Where communication can certainly sometimes prove to be challenging over
        the initial teething period of us working with other coming from
        different countries, there has been good personal and professional
        rapport established over time, with a good number of laughs and in tow
        over the last few months of collaborations. Projects I have worked on
        with him being getting our new homepage up with the authentication and
        navigations, and recently our managed services feature for sales
        activations. No matter what the problem is, Dimitar always starts with
        the right question, ie. 'Why?'.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dimitar knowledge shares, keeping us updated on progress and adds
        diversity to the way solutions are discovered. I have appreciated the
        time we have worked together and sincerely thank Dimitar.
