      <p>
        Dimitar is an excellent programmer and soul of the team. I am glad that
        I be given the opportunity to recommend it because I have a very
        positive impression of his personality. We spent over a year and a half
        working together in 158ltd.com. and in that time he managed to pass me a
        lot of knowledge in the IT field. Whenever I needed help or advice he
        has responded and helped me. I'm sure Dimitar would be a great part of
        every team.
