        My professional career started ten years ago. For this period I
        "visited" a significant amount of kingdoms 👑. My roles were "warrior"
        (backend developer), "engineer" (front - end developer), "magician"
        (team leader and software architect), "the assassin" (freelancer /
        <Keyword word="remote contractor" />) and even the "main officer" (CTO).
        When I worked like a warrior 💪: I wrote a significant amount of scripts
        which automated some boring repetitive tasks for my stakeholders and the
        end - users. To be an engineer 🛠 is an awesome job because your main
        focus is creating beautiful and helpful instruments. These instruments
        reduced the main pain of each system: Adding, filtering data and state
        management. The magician role 🧙‍♀️ was a tough and motivational task in my
        career. My leadership skills cut the deadlines. The source code quality
        was improved. The business won several important contracts. My skills as
        an assassin 🔪 increased the company revenue. I've confident to work if
        the deadlines are urgent.
